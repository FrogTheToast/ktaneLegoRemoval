  description: 'Dismantle a structure of plastic bricks under an ordered sequence.


    my second module.

    In its current state the structure generation runs well, but at some point I need
    to optimize it because of how heavily it relies on randomness.

    If the structure generates with a number of bricks outside of the 42-70 range,
    it won''t affect the gameplay in any way :)
